Priority:
-> idk man: need to get the model of the surrounding UMB environment (classroom, library, general surrounding of the campus)
in progress: need to figure out how to modify/create individual item in the above environment
finished: need to figre out how to create reverse rain effect
   -> create puddle next

low tier priority:
simulate the flow of time somehow
simulate different storm effect
add sounds to the storm

-add in multiple rain effects
-add a background - a sky? make it warped as the storms goes on  / or just add a few clouds
-make the lightsource only the the lamps and motorcycle light?
-create the storm scene where rain and objects floating are gradually increasing, the speed is increasing exponentially
-add a camera perspective for the storm scene - a far away one and one that looks like you are in the midst of it
-when the storm scenerio starts, have a preset ambient light
-when storm scenario starts have the fog slowly transition in

-when objects are floating in the air you can interact with either hand movement or mouse
