# The-Reverse-Storm
Let the Rain Raise

# Description
The-Reverse-Storm is a visualisation of an apocalyptic storm taken inspiration from the WNDR Museum's Inside Out and The Storm from the game Reverse1999.  Like the name of the project suggests, it is a recreation of a storm but has certain elements of "reversing" such as how the rain starts from the ground and flows upward.  The main visuals also include chaotic elements with floating objects and destruction.  The storm is demonstrated in a "scene" which lasts around 1min and 30secs and can then be reset.

# Usage
Upon loading the page up, the scene immediately starts.  After the scene ends and the terrain resets, the scene can be
started up again by pressing "r".  Other controls include the scene UI which can adjust light, ambient light, fog and light intensity.  For manual interaction, Pressing "q" will toggle on-click destruction.  Pressing "w" will toggle object select, combined with the "e" rotation toggle will highlight and rotate objects once clicked.

# Future Improvements
We are still considering the best way to consider using object munipulation to demonstrate the scene so the objects can
move the way we want to exactly.  For example we want to improve the movement of the cups to flow more upwards and in a circular
movemenet while still containing wobbling.  Some other improvements would be adding a background that fits and creating a more
dynamic scene with lightsource that comes from the lamps.

# Common problems and solutions
Since the 3D model was imported from an outside source, there are some difficulties with munipulating the objects.  The
current solution to this was to use to find the names or commonalities of the object groups through selection to
munipulate each object.
